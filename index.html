    <h2>
        About TUYU  
    </h2>


    <p>
        A music unit consisting of Pusu on guitar and in charge of composing 
        the songs, Rei as vocals, <br> and miro on piano.The group was formed on June 
        12, 2019. Its name comes from the Japanese <br>word for “rainy season”
        during which it was formed.They're constantly ranked in both Japanese<br> 
        and foreign music distribution sites and appear in their popular playlists. 
        A group of artists to keep an <br>eye on with many fans around the world. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        On May 31st, 2024, Pusu (ぷす), also known as Yano Asaya (矢野麻也), 
        was arrested for the attempted <br>murder of a teenage girl he was dating.
        According to the Metropolitan Police Department, a caller reported<br> that
        he had stabbed her in a room of an apartment in Ogata, Nakano Ward,
        just before 10:00 a.m.<br> When police officers arrived at the scene, they 
        found a girl that had been stabbed in the chest.<br> She was later taken to 
        the hospital, and is still conscious. As a result of his arrest, TUYU 
        disbanded.
    </p>

   <p>
        On June 8, 2024, Rei, miro, and AzyuN made their final statements on 
        TUYU's official twitter,<br> announcing the end of TUYU.
    </p>

    <p>
        On November 26, 2024, Pusu announced that he would delete all of 
        TUYU's music on<br> December 31st, 2024 at 23:59 (11:59 PM) JST. However,
        on January 1, 2025, TUYU announced <br>that they would not delete all of 
        TUYU's music due to the majority opposing it, <br>and also dismissed Pusu 
        from the group, and therefore stopping the deletion of TUYU's music. <br>
        Their newest album “Under mentality” was deleted, but the other 2
        albums were kept safe. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        Why I love TUYU 
    </h2>

    <p>
        TUYU is a j-rock band that make such amazing music. As a musician who 
        listens to anything as long<br> as it's good, <br>TUYU was a band that I had been 
        looking for. Its theory and musicality in the music is simply<br> stunning and 
        the singer has such a beautiful voice. Not just this, but the pianist, Miro, 
        and the guitarist, pusu,  <br>have mastered their art in musicianship. This 
        causes for their music to be so complex and great. <br> Whenever im doing 
        some mundane task that allows me to listen to music while performing 
        the task,<br> I always listen to TUYU.
