        <p>
            On May 31st, 2024, Pusu (ぷす), also known as Yano Asaya (矢野麻也), <br>
            was arrested for the attempted murder of a teenage girl he was dating. <br>
            According to the Metropolitan Police Department, a caller reported that <br>
            he had stabbed her in a room of an apartment in Ogata, Nakano Ward, <br>
            just before 10:00 a.m. When police officers arrived at the scene, they <br>
            found a girl that had been stabbed in the chest. She was later taken to <br>

            disbanded.
        </p>

        <p>
            On June 8, 2024, Rei, miro, and AzyuN made their final statements on <br>
            TUYU's official twitter, announcing the end of TUYU.
        </p>

        <p>
            On November 26, 2024, Pusu announced that he would delete all of <br>
            TUYU's music on December 31st, 2024 at 23:59 (11:59 PM) JST. However, <br>
            on January 1, 2025, TUYU announced that they would not delete all of <br>
            TUYU's music due to the majority opposing it, and also dismissed Pusu <br>
            from the group, and therefore stopping the deletion of TUYU's music. <br>
            Their newest album “Under mentality” was deleted, but the other 2 <br>
            albums were kept safe. 
        </p>

        <h2>
        Why I love TUYU 
        </h2>

        <p>
            TUYU is a j-rock band that make such amazing music. As a musician who <br>
            listens to anything as long as it's good, TUYU was a band that I had been <br>
            looking for. Its theory and musicality in the music is simply stunning and <br>
            the singer has such a beautiful voice. Not just this, but the pianist, Miro, <br>
            and the guitarist, pusu,  have mastered their art in musicianship. This <br>
            causes for their music to be so complex and great.  Whenever im doing <br>
            some mundane task that allows me to listen to music while performing <br>
            the task, I always listen to TUYU.
